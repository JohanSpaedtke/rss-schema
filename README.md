RSS Schema
----------

Since RSS doesn't have an official XSD, I made one with the Eclipse Schema Editor. I'm thinking about a small project where this might come in handy. If I won't pursue it, at least this will be my contribution to humanity.

If this project is built with Maven, Java classes are created that are suitable for use with JAXB. However the model can be used by itself too.

License
-------

Usually I use BSD but I can't be bothered for a little smidge like that. Do what you want and if you need something more legalese, use [CC0][CC0].

TODO
----

- add modules like Media, OpenSearch, iTunes and whatnot
